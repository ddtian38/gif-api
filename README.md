# gif-api

This web app allows user to download and add their favorite GIFs from Star Wars. Alongside it also gives users information about 
eight Star Wars movie that are created. The app uses GPI API to retrieve the topics that are on the buttons. One of the main challenges
when developing this app was creating the favorite feature. Cookies were used to store information of the GIF and the favorite_app.js for the 
favorite.html pulls the data from the cookie and displays the GIF on the web page.
